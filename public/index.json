Bias refers to an inclination toward something without considering all that is at stake. For instance, if you and your friends always prefer a certain type of food based on past experiences, you might ignore other great options simply because you’re used to your favorite dish. And, let me tell you, friend, that’s bias. 🍔🍕\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e» Now, what about bias in analytics, and how is it connected to underfitting? Imagine you and your friends are the machine learning model trying to predict how good a dish at a restaurant is. If you focus only on a few factors, such as price or ingredients, while ignoring key aspects like customer reviews, the chef’s experience, the restaurant’s location, and others, your predictions could be biased. This happens because the model oversimplifies the problem, making it unable to learn enough from the training data. As a result, if the features you’re using to judge new dishes are limited or less important, this leads to high bias and, consequently, underfitting. 🧩❓\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e                                    \u003cimg src=\"/images/bias_variance_tradeoff/1.png\" alt=\"Bias Example\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e𝗩𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 📈\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e» What about variance in everyday life? Variance refers to differences in how people respond to the same situation. For example, imagine you and your friends watch the same movie. If most of you think it’s great, the variance is low.

Imagine you and your friends are the machine learning model trying to predict how good a movie is. If you focus on every little detail from the movies you like—such as specific phrases in the reviews, ratings, one-off opinions, and others—your predictions may work perfectly for those cases and similar ones. However, when faced with new movies that don’t match those patterns, your predictions become inconsistent and unreliable. And that, my friend, is overfitting because you, as a model, are too rooted in the characteristics of the training data—in this case, the detailed features you focused on from the movies you like.
